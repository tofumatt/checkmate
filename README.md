# Checkmate

**This project is not yet ready nor is master remotely working properly.
Consider the project status: _coming soon_.**

This is a next-gen version of the Foursquare client I wrote called [around][].
Though it borrows very little code it inherits its spirit and aim: to create
a great Foursquare app for any web client.

This version is built on [Ember] and [ember-cli], as well as [Cordova].
